      <p>
        I believe design is more than aestheticsâ€”it's about solving problems
        with empathy and purpose. With 3+ years of experience, I craft modern
        user interfaces that balance creativity with function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's a healthcare dashboard or a playful kids flashcard, I
        design with intention, clarity, and accessibility.
